# .dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed with ???.

## Setup

Ensure that SSH keys have been setup on system, I use 1Password for this, and I
typically install 1Password through Homebrew Cask, so that is a requirement.
Follow instructions at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

Clone dotfiles repo into a location such as `~/.dotfiles`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dylanpinn/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
