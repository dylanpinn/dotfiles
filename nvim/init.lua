-- This is my Neovim config, I try to use vanilla Vim for most usecases but if
-- I require LSP support then I will use Neovim.

-- This has been setup to work with Scala (TODO) and TypeScript (TODO).

-- Load all of the required plugins, they are managed by Packer (which is
-- a fully featured plugin manager).  Unsure if I need to use something as
-- fully featured as Packer or if can use something more lightweight like paq.
