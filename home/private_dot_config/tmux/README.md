# Tmux Configuration

Currently my tmux configuration is pretty sparse. The main change is to the
prefix keybinding from `C-b` to `C-a`. This matches the original keybinding that
was present in `screen` and feels more natural to me rather than reaching for
`C-b`.

Other changes are quality of life improvements for working with (neo)vim inside
tmux.
